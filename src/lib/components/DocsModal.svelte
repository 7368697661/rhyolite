            content: `## Projects
A project is your top-level container for a creative work. Each project has:
- **Bedrock**: Core canon and world rules — ALWAYS injected into every sculptor and chisel prompt
- **The Grain**: High-level narrative structure, also included as context

## Crystals (Documents)
Crystals are your primary writing documents — chapters, scenes, drafts. They live in the sidebar under your project and can be organized into folders.
- The center editor supports markdown with live preview
- When a crystal is selected, the AI chat automatically uses it as context
- Use folders to organize by act, section, or however you prefer

## Artifacts (Wiki Entries)
Artifacts are your project encyclopedia — characters, locations, factions, magic systems, items. They work like wiki pages.
- The AI automatically retrieves relevant artifacts when you mention them in chat
- Each artifact can have **aliases** (comma-separated) so the AI recognizes different names
- In **Carve mode**, the AI can create and edit artifacts directly
- Artifacts support keyword search AND semantic (meaning-based) search

## Veins (Timelines / DAGs)
Veins are visual directed acyclic graphs for plotting your story's connective tissue.
- **Nodes** represent events, scenes, or plot points
- **Edges** represent causality, sequence, or relationships between events
- Nodes can be tagged with artifact references for cross-linking
- Nodes can reference a crystal document for deeper content
- Veins are included in RAG context — the AI can retrieve relevant events
- Apply **Reliefs** (templates) to quickly scaffold common structures

## Studio (Chat)
Each crystal, artifact, or vein gets its own AI chat session attached to a glyph (AI persona).
- Use **@mentions** in the input to pin specific crystals or artifacts as context
- Attach files from disk via the paperclip button
- The context token estimate in the header shows a live breakdown on hover`,

            id: "modes",
            title: "Studio Modes",
            content: `## Inspect Mode (Ask)
Default mode. Single-turn Q&A with RAG (retrieval-augmented generation).
- The AI reads your current crystal, relevant artifacts, vein context, bedrock, and the grain
- Great for brainstorming, getting feedback, asking "what if" questions
- No tools — the AI can only read, not modify your project

## Carve Mode (Agent)
Full tool-using AI mode. The AI can search, read, create, update, and delete project entities.
- **17 tools** across artifacts, veins, documents, search, link resolution, and chisel delegation
- **Risky actions** (delete operations, large rewrites) require your approval via an inline confirmation prompt
- Multi-turn: the AI can chain multiple tool calls in a single response
- Safety cap of 20 tool iterations per message (8 per chisel inner loop) to prevent runaway loops
- After carving actions, the sidebar automatically refreshes

### Available Tools
| Tool | Risk | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| search_artifacts | Safe | Token-based keyword + embedding RAG search across wiki entries and documents |
| read_artifact | Safe | Read full content of a wiki entry |
| create_artifact | Normal | Create a new wiki entry |
| update_artifact | Normal | Edit an existing wiki entry |
| delete_artifact | **Risky** | Permanently delete a wiki entry |
| read_timeline | Safe | Read vein graph (nodes + edges) |
| create_timeline_node | Normal | Add event node to a vein |
| update_timeline_node | Normal | Edit a vein node |
| delete_timeline_node | **Risky** | Delete node + connected edges |
| create_edge | Normal | Connect two vein nodes (auto-layouts DAG) |
| auto_layout_dag | Safe | Reposition all nodes using layered DAG layout |
| delete_edge | **Risky** | Remove a connection |
| read_draft | Safe | Read current document content |
| append_to_draft | Normal | Append text to active document |
| search_project | Safe | Token-based keyword + embedding RAG search across all entities |
| resolve_dead_links | Normal | Find dead [[wikilinks]] in a document and create stub artifacts |
| delegate_to_specialist | Normal | Delegate a task to a chisel sub-agent glyph |
| delegate_fan_out | Normal | Run multiple chisels in parallel |

## Blueprint Mode (Plan)
Propose-then-execute mode. The AI creates a structured plan of tool calls for your review.
- The AI outputs a checklist of proposed actions with rationale for each
- You can approve/reject individual steps
- Click "Execute" to run the approved steps sequentially
- All steps get confirmation UI regardless of risk level (that's the point of blueprint mode)
- Great for complex operations where you want full control`,

            id: "glyphs",
            title: "Glyphs (Personas)",
            content: `## What are Glyphs?
Glyphs are configurable AI personas that control the behavior of your Studio sessions. Each glyph has:
- **Name**: Display name for the persona
- **System Instruction**: The base prompt that shapes the AI's personality and capabilities
- **Model**: Which AI model to use (Gemini, GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- **Provider**: Which LLM provider to use (Gemini, OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic)
- **Temperature**: Controls creativity/randomness (0 = focused, 1 = creative)
- **Max Output Tokens**: Maximum response length
- **Sculptor toggle**: Whether this glyph appears in the Studio picker
- **Chisel Tag**: Optional role tag for chisel glyphs (e.g. "researcher", "continuity")

## Sculptors vs Chisels
- **Sculptors** are the entry-point glyphs shown in the Studio glyph picker. They run top-level chat sessions and can delegate work to chisels.
- **Chisels** are sub-agent templates that do NOT appear in the picker. They are invoked via the delegate_to_specialist or delegate_fan_out tools during a Carve mode session.
- Existing glyphs without these fields default to Sculptor (backward-compatible).

## How Delegation Works
In Carve mode, a Sculptor can call delegate_to_specialist with a chisel glyph ID and a task description. The system runs a nested agent loop using the chisel's provider, model, system instruction, and config. The chisel can use all standard tools (but cannot delegate further). Results are returned to the Sculptor as a tool result.

For parallel delegation, the Sculptor can call delegate_fan_out with multiple chisel/task pairs. All run concurrently and results are collected.

### Limits
- **Outer loop (Sculptor)**: 20 iterations max
- **Inner loop (each Chisel)**: 8 iterations max
- Risky actions by chisels still require user confirmation

## Example Chisel Roles
- **Researcher**: Deep-dives into artifacts and veins for context gathering
- **Continuity**: Checks existing lore and flags inconsistencies
- **Architect**: Manages DAG structures and event creation
- **Editor**: Reviews and polishes crystal drafts

## Creating Glyphs
Navigate to the Glyph Registry page to create custom personas. Uncheck "Sculptor (Show in Studio)" to make a glyph a chisel template.`,

            title: "Context & RAG",
            content: `## The 5-Pillar Context Engine
Every message you send through Studio assembles context from five sources before reaching the AI:

### 1. Bedrock + Grain (System Instruction)
Your project's Bedrock (core canon) and Grain (story outline) are always injected into the system instruction. This provides the AI with permanent knowledge about your world.

### 2. Conversation History
The full branch of messages from the current chat session is included, allowing multi-turn reasoning.

### 3. Artifact RAG (Wiki)
The system automatically retrieves relevant artifacts based on:
- **Keyword matching**: If a wiki entry's title or aliases appear in your recent messages or current draft
- **Semantic search**: Embedding-based similarity finds related entries even without exact name matches
- Results are deduplicated and injected as context

### 4. Vein RAG (Timeline Events)
Timeline event titles, content, and summaries are embedded in the RAG index. When you're working on a vein or mentioning related events, they are retrieved as context.

### 5. Draft Windowing
When editing a crystal, a windowed excerpt of the current document (focused around your cursor position) is included as context.

## Live Token Estimate
The CTX indicator in the Studio header shows an estimated token count. Hover over it to see a breakdown of each context component (History, Artifacts, Veins, Draft, System + Bedrock).

## @Mentions
Type \`@\` in the Studio input to pin specific crystals or artifacts as context. These are injected directly into your message, ensuring the AI sees the full content of the mentioned entity regardless of RAG scoring.`,

            content: `## Obsidian Vault Support
Rhyolite can use an Obsidian vault as its project directory. Your .md files are readable and editable in both apps.

## How It Works
- **Title-based filenames**: Crystals and artifacts are saved as \`Title.md\` (e.g. \`The Four Powers.md\`) instead of random IDs
- **ID in frontmatter**: Each file stores its internal Rhyolite ID in YAML frontmatter, keeping the file linkable even if renamed
- **\`[[Wikilinks]]\`**: Double-bracket links (\`[[Character Name]]\` or \`[[Title|display text]]\`) and standard markdown links (\`[Display](<Target>)\`) are recognized as entity references and rendered as clickable links
- **Metadata in \`.rhyolite/\`**: Project config lives in \`.rhyolite/project.json\`, keeping Obsidian's root clean

## Open Folder
In the project dropdown, select **Open Folder...** to open a native OS folder picker. Rhyolite will:
- Register the folder natively via \`known-projects.json\`
- Scan subdirectories directly, creating matching folders in the sidebar
- File operations (move, rename, delete) reflect immediately on disk

## Dead Link Resolver
The **Resolve [[links]]** button in the document editor scans the active crystal for \`[[wikilinks]]\` that don't point to any existing artifact or document.
- It runs a **3-stage chisel pipeline** (Researcher → Writer → Auditor) with live streaming progress
- Creates fully-fleshed, template-compliant articles using RAG context
- Configure the \`researcher\`, \`writer\`, and \`auditor\` chisel glyphs to tune behavior
- Also available as the \`resolve_dead_links\` tool in Carve mode`,
